* Practical Astroinformatics
** Abstract: 
   From the dawn of its existence astronomy has been starving for data
   but in the last few decades the situation has changed and now we
   are facing data deluge of biblical proportions. The data are not
   just increasing in size but also in complexity and dimensionality.
   Astroinformatics is the new field of science which has emerged from
   this technology driven progress. Virtual Observatory, Machine
   Learning, Data Mining and Grid Computing are just few examples of
   new tools available to scientists. This talk is an overview of the
   main concepts, tools and methods behind astroinfomatics with the
   emphasis on practical applications.
